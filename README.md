## [简介](https://github.com/sochub/CA7/wiki)

[Cortex-A7](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-a/cortex-a7) processor provides up to 20% more single thread performance than the Cortex-A5. The processor incorporates all features of the high-performance Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A17 processors, including virtualization support in hardware, Large Physical Address Extensions (LPAE), Neon, and 128-bit AMBA 4 AXI bus interface.

- Architecture: Armv7-A
- Multicore: 1-4 cores

In a 28nm process, the Cortex-A7 can run at 1.2-1.6GHz, has an area of 0.45mm2 (with Floating-Point Unit, Neon and a 32KB L1 cache) and requires less than 100mW of total power in typical conditions. This lowest performance profile makes it an ideal standalone processor for a range of mobile devices, and means the Cortex-A7 can ultimately deliver similar performance to the Cortex-A9 processor at much higher levels of power efficiency.
